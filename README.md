# Palindrom Checker Project

## Description:
FreeCodeCamp's JavaScript course project to build an application that checks whether a given word is a palindrome.

This is one of the required projects (the first) to earn my certification. I built this project entirely from scratch using the User Stories provided by freeCodeCamp.
